# Bootstrap Website & Greensock Animation

You are to demonstrate that you know how to use basic HTML and CSS by building a responsive single page marketing webpage for one of these three companies:

*Road Warriors* - Bike shop

*Cozy Corner* - Book store

*Calm Mind* - Spa

You will use one of these companies as a guide for your content.  For design, you will need to find a website that you admire as a guide for layout.  You will then combine the company content and the layout of the website you admire to create a single page marketing site.
